These are all the available tags that you can use to adjust the voice file:

    {break xms} -Wait for x miliseconds. x=integer
    {emp [strong,moderate,none,reduced] 'Text you want to emphasize that will appear in the article'}
    {read [strong,moderate,none,reduced] 'Text you want to be read but not show in the article}
    {noread 'This is text in the article that will appear but will not be read'}
    {voice '[male,female]'} -Change the voice with which the rest of the text will be read 
    {audio 'url'} -Play an mp3 file that is publicly accessible from the web 
        either put in the url or embed the url inside the word

Do not use single quotes inside the tags, the AI will read the text correctly without them. 

You can toggle the visibility of the tags using the toggle tags button located in settings->post->Text to speech
    The tags will be completely removed if anyone except an admin is viweing the article.
    They will not affect the yoast SEO as it uses only html visible to the viewer. 

The podcast file will appear in the media library and you can then add it to the article or distribute.

Options for each audio:
    Voice 
        English/Czech
        Male/female
        If the langauge is different from the content of the post, the AI will still pronounce it in a broken accent.
    Speed:
        A range from 50% to 200% of normal speaking rate
    Volume:
        [Default, X-soft, Soft, Medium, Loud, X-Loud]
        The Defualt is virtualy the same as Medium, but for each voice the default and therefore most natural volume is different
        Default is advised
    Include image alt:
        If chosen then the alt text of all images will be read in the voce file.
        If not chosen then the images will not show up in the voice file at all.
    File Name*:
        Optional to name the voice file in the media library
        If nothing is provided then the post-id is used as the name
